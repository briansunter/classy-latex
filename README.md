# LaTeX Classes

Just some LaTeX classes I wrote for personal use. Feel free to use them if you like. Examples are available as `example.tex` in the subdirectory, and compiled example PDFs are available for the [resume][] and the [business card][card]

These classes use the "Ubuntu Light" font, which can be obtained from [The Ubuntu font site][ubuntu].
